🎬 Netflix Shows & Movies Analysis

Dataset: Netflix Movies and TV Shows (Kaggle)

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Netflix content to uncover insights about movies and TV shows. It demonstrates data preprocessing, visualization, statistics, feature engineering, and SQL-like queries using Pandas.

📖 Project Overview

The dataset contains information about thousands of Netflix titles, including type, title, director, cast, country, release year, rating, duration, and genres.
The goal of this project is to explore patterns and answer questions such as:

Are movies or TV shows more common?

Which countries produce the most content?

What are the most popular genres?

How has Netflix content evolved over the years?

✅ Key Tasks Performed
🔹 Data Understanding & Cleaning

Loaded dataset into Pandas DataFrame

Checked shape, columns, missing values, and duplicates

Parsed dates, durations, and genres

🔹 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Movies vs TV Shows distribution

Top 10 countries producing content

Top 10 most common genres

Release year trends

Histogram of movie durations

Titles added per year

🔹 Statistics

Mean, Median, Mode of release years

Variance & Standard Deviation

% of titles added in last 5 years

Most common ratings for Movies vs TV Shows

🔹 NumPy & Linear Algebra

NumPy arrays for release_year and is_movie

Vector addition & dot product

Feature matrix with weights

Normalization of release_year

🔹 Calculus

Derived formula for Popularity Score and calculated derivative

🔹 Feature Engineering

Created new columns: content_age, is_movie, recent_release, num_genres, quartile rank

🔹 SQL Simulation in Pandas

Movies released after 2015

Sorted movies by year and title

Top 5 countries by content count

Titles between 2000–2010

Count of titles with “Drama” in genres

🔹 Insights

United States produces the most Netflix content

Peak content releases between 2018–2020

Movies dominate over TV Shows

Drama is the most frequent genre

🛠️ Tools & Libraries

Python 🐍

pandas, NumPy for data handling

matplotlib, seaborn for visualization

scipy for statistics

sympy for calculus

Jupyter Notebook / VS Code for development

📊 Insights

Movies are more frequent than TV shows on Netflix

US & India dominate content production

Drama and Comedy are the top genres

Netflix rapidly expanded content around 2018–2020

🏁 Conclusion

Effective EDA: Clear patterns in genres, release years, and country contributions

Learning Outcome: Improved understanding of Pandas, NumPy, visualization, statistics, and GitHub workflow

Real-World Use: These insights can guide recommendations, content strategy, and market analysis
